# How To use the .ipynb files, the 2 python notebooks
We will go through 2 sections:
- Firstly, how to use and setup GoogleColab and run the 2 notebooks.
- Secondly, how to change datasets and re-train or test with other datasets.
## 1) How to run the notebooks
We have to setup Google Colab.
### Setup Google Colab and Google Drive
- Firstly, copy these 2 python notebooks in the folder in the Google Drive, containing the Google Colabs notebooks
- Secondly, copy the folder "SB - Project Work" with its contents in your Google Drive, right under the main folder of Drive (so no folder contains SB - Project Work)

Now we can run the notebooks.
### Run the notebooks
- Open the 2 notebooks with Google Colab and run all theirs cells.
- P.S.: Be careful that the first notebook will take around 1h to 1h and half, while the second one around 5minutes.

## 2) How to change the dataset and re-train and/or test with other datasets
We have to change the datasets.
### Change dataset(s)
- Firstly, go into the "SB - Project Work" folder.
    - In this folder you will find the datasets, there will be the main one, "features_rings.csv", the one used for training "train.csv" and the one used for testing "test.csv". 
    - P.S.: the train and test one at the moment, are a copy of features_rings.csv.
- Secondly, prepare the new dataset(s), either for training or testing, or both. 
    - P.S.: you will have to provide already a .csv file.
- Thirdly, substitute the new dataset(s), if for training, call the new dataset "train.csv", if for testing call the new dataset "test.csv".
- Fourthly, re-run the notebooks. 
    - P.S.: if you changed only the testing dataset, is enough to just re-run the 2nd notebook for testing, without re-training.
